## Breast Cancer Classification using Decision Tree

This project implements a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset. The project involves data exploration, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation.




### Overview
The objective of this project is to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using a Decision Tree model. The dataset is sourced from scikit-learn's built-in Breast Cancer dataset, which contains features like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.

This project is part of an internship with **CodTech**, focusing on building and visualizing machine learning models for classification.

### Dataset
- **Source:** scikit-learn's built-in Breast Cancer dataset
- **Classes:** Malignant (0), Benign (1)
- **Features:** 30 numeric features describing tumor characteristics
- **Instances:** 569 samples

---

### Technologies Used
- **Python** - Programming Language
- **scikit-learn** - Model building and evaluation
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization

---

### Model Implementation
The following steps were implemented:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loaded the dataset and explored its features and target classes.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Checked for missing values and scaled features where necessary.
3. **Model Building:** Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.
4. **Model Training:** Trained the model on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30%.
5. **Prediction and Evaluation:** Made predictions and evaluated the model using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

---

### Visualization and Analysis
- **Decision Tree Visualization:** Visualized the trained decision tree using `plot_tree` from scikit-learn.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Plotted a heatmap for the confusion matrix using Seaborn.

---

### Results
- **Accuracy:** 94.15%  
- **Precision and Recall:**  
  - Malignant: Precision = 90%, Recall = 95%  
  - Benign: Precision = 97%, Recall = 94%  
- The model performs well with a high accuracy and balanced precision-recall scores for both classes.
